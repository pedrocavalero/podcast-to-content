# The Future is Now: Why You Need to Embrace AI in Your Development Workflow

Hey fellow devs,

We've talked about the impact of AI on our productivity, the changing role of the developer, and how to get started with AI-powered tools. But what does the future hold? In our recent chat, we all agreed on one thing: the future of AI in software development is already here, and it's time to embrace it.

As Igor put it, "if you don't know this stuff you will be out you'll be out of the market we are seeing massive layouts everywhere in the world in every companies and you do need to learn about that and you need to to show that you know about that as well because if you know that but no one knows that you know it's not worthy so it's it's uh very important."

This is a powerful message, and it underscores the urgency of the situation. AI is no longer a niche technology that's only used by a few aselect companies. It's quickly becoming a mainstream tool that's being used by developers all over the world. And as the technology continues to improve, it's only going to become more integrated into our development workflows.

But this isn't something to be afraid of. On the contrary, it's an incredible opportunity. As I said in our talk, "I can't write anything without this guide anymore. Of course I can. But this is and then when we when we think about oh I don't have any AI tool now I say oh my god it looks like you're changing your uh go waiting back to the to the old ages doing like the the the neon house."

So, what can you do to prepare for this future? Here are a few suggestions:

*   **Start learning now:** Don't wait until AI has completely transformed the industry to start learning about it. Start now, while the technology is still evolving.
*   **Experiment with different tools:** There are a lot of great AI-powered development tools out there. Try out a few different ones to see which ones you like best.
*   **Share your knowledge:** As you learn more about AI, share your knowledge with other developers. The more we can all learn from each other, the better prepared we'll be for the future.

Happy coding!

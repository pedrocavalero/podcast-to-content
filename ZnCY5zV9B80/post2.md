# Are You a Coder or a Problem Solver? How AI is Redefining the Developer Role

Hi team,

For years, we've been known as "coders." We're the ones who write the code that makes the world go 'round. But what if I told you that our role is changing? With the rise of AI, we're evolving from simply writing code to becoming true problem solvers and software engineers.

In our recent discussion, Igor made a bold statement: "coders they are death AI will replace them. There are there are no place for coders anymore. What everyone needs to understand that now you need to be a problem solver, a softening gainer that is a problem solver that understands it all." This might sound a bit dramatic, but there's a lot of truth to it.

AI is getting incredibly good at writing code. As I shared in my own experience, I've been able to generate massive amounts of code with the help of AI tools. But here's the key: I'm still the one who is responsible for that code. As I said in the talk, "you are responsible about your code, right?"

This is where the shift in our role becomes clear. We're no longer just the ones typing out the code. We're the ones who are guiding the AI, reviewing its output, and ensuring that the final product is high-quality, secure, and meets the needs of our users. As Chilla put it, our role is "shifting a little bit what you Exactly. Exactly."

So, what does this mean for us in our day-to-day work? It means we need to focus on developing our problem-solving skills. We need to be able to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces that we can then delegate to our AI assistants. And we need to be able to critically evaluate the code that our AI assistants generate, and make sure that it's up to our standards.

What do you think about this change in our role? Are you excited about the opportunity to become more of a problem solver and less of a coder? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!

Happy coding!

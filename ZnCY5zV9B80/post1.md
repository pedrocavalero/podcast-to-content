# Supercharge Your Code: How AI Is Boosting Developer Productivity

Hey fellow devs!

Have you ever wondered how much AI can really impact our work? We're not talking about sci-fi movies here, but real, tangible results in our day-to-day coding lives. In a recent chat with my friends Igor and Chilla, I shared some of my own experiences with using AI-powered tools, and the results were pretty mind-blowing.

As I mentioned in our talk, I saw a massive jump in my own productivity. I'm talking about a **five-fold increase in the number of lines of code** I was able to write. But it's not just about quantity, right? It's about the quality and the whole development process. I also saw **three times more features and PRs created**, which means I was able to deliver more value, faster.

But here's the really cool part. I was able to break down the code I wrote into different categories: feature code, testing code, and documentation. And what I found was that AI helped me improve in all of these areas. I wrote almost **four times more feature code**, **six times more testing code**, and a whopping **eight times more documentation**. As I said in the talk, "it's kind of incredible."

This isn't just about me, though. This is a trend that's happening across the industry. As Igor pointed out, "developers that knows AI will replace those that do those that doesn't know AI at all." This is a powerful statement, and it highlights the importance of embracing these new tools.

So, what does this mean for you? It means that now is the time to start exploring how AI can help you become a more productive and effective developer. Whether it's by writing code faster, generating more comprehensive tests, or creating better documentation, AI can be a powerful ally in your development workflow.

What are your thoughts on this? Have you tried using any AI-powered development tools yet? Share your experiences in the comments below!

Happy coding!

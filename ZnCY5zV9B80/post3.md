# The AI Developer's Toolkit: A Guide to the Best Tools and Their Costs

Hey fellow devs!

So, you're ready to dive into the world of AI-powered development? Awesome! But with so many tools out there, it can be hard to know where to start. In our recent chat, we talked about some of the most popular tools on the market, as well as their pricing models, to help you make the right choice for your needs and budget.

First up, let's talk about the big players. We have tools like **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Gemini Code Assist**, and **Amazon Q**. These are all powerful tools that can help you write code faster, generate tests, and even debug your code. As I mentioned, "Corso is very good on that like it prices is $20 a month if you start using it."

But what if you're on a budget? Don't worry, there are plenty of great options for you too. We talked about open-source tools like **Client** and **Open Code**, which you can use for free. And as Igor pointed out, you can use a service like **Open Router** to access a variety of different AI models at a lower cost. As I showed in the talk, you can use models like the new K3 color for "onetenth the price" of the more expensive models.

Here's a quick breakdown of some of the tools we discussed:

*   **Cursor:** A powerful and popular tool with a focus on agent-like features. ($20/month)
*   **GitHub Copilot:** A mature and widely used tool that's great for autocompletion. ($10/month)
*   **Gemini Code Assist:** A new and promising tool from Google. ($19/month)
*   **Amazon Q:** A powerful tool from Amazon that's integrated with AWS. ($19/month)
*   **Client and Open Code:** Open-source tools that you can use for free with your own API keys.
*   **Open Router:** A service that lets you access a variety of AI models at a lower cost.

So, which tool is right for you? It really depends on your needs and budget. If you're looking for a powerful, all-in-one tool, then Cursor or GitHub Copilot might be a good choice. But if you're on a budget, or if you want to experiment with different AI models, then Client or Open Code with Open Router might be a better option.

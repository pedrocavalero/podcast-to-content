# From Vibe Coding to Blind Coding: How to Get Started with AI-Powered Development

Hi team,

Ready to jump on the AI-powered development train? It's an exciting ride, but it's important to know how to get started on the right foot. In our recent conversation, we shared some practical tips to help you navigate this new landscape and avoid some common pitfalls.

First things first, you need to choose the right tool for the job. As we discussed, there are a lot of great options out there, from powerful, all-in-one tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot to free, open-source options like Client and Open Code. The best way to find the right tool for you is to simply **try them out**. As I said, "they open they opened it to the engineers to try out they they give it a budget so we could use right a small budget like it's it was not not not so more than one subscription of that. So you could try you could get one month of Git compil get one month another one you know and test."

Once you've chosen a tool, it's time to start experimenting. But here's a crucial piece of advice: **don't be a blind coder**. As one of our viewers pointed out in a previous session, "if you're vibe coding if you're not looking at your code you are not vibe coding you are blind coding." This is a fantastic quote, and it highlights the importance of always reviewing and understanding the code that your AI assistant generates.

Here are a few tips to help you get started:

*   **Start small:** Don't try to build a complex application from scratch on your first day. Start with a small, simple task, like writing a unit test or a simple function.
*   **Be specific:** The more specific you are with your prompts, the better the results will be. As Igor explained, "if you give it guidelines on how an application should uh behave in my case I gave him the spring uh and Java microservices guidelines and also feeded these guidelines with more content with what I needed for my specific service and provided the prompt uh with h the details that I wanted. The results were very very precise."
*   **Review, review, review:** Always review the code that your AI assistant generates. Make sure you understand what it's doing, and that it meets your standards for quality and security.

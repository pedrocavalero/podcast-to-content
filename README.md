# Podcast to Content

This project provides a set of workflows to automate content creation from podcasts and videos. It helps you repurpose your existing content into different formats like blog posts and short video clips.

Currently, there are three main workflows available:

1.  **Autoblog Workflow:** Converts a YouTube video into a series of blog posts, complete with featured images, and publishes them to WordPress.
2.  **Video Cuts Workflow:** Extracts interesting segments from a YouTube video, generates thumbnails, and uploads them as new short videos to YouTube.
3.  **YouTube Video to Shorts Workflow:** Downloads a YouTube video and its subtitles, analyzes the content to find valuable segments, creates YouTube Shorts from those segments, and generates metadata for a shorts channel.

## Autoblog Workflow

This workflow automates the process of converting a YouTube video into a series of blog posts and publishing them to WordPress.

### Features

-   **YouTube Video Transcription:** Automatically transcribes the audio from a YouTube video.
-   **Content Summarization:** Analyzes the transcript and identifies the main topics.
-   **Blog Post Generation:** Creates multiple blog posts based on the identified topics.
-   **AI-Powered Image Generation:** Generates a unique featured image for each blog post.
-   **WordPress Integration:** Uploads the generated blog posts and featured images to a WordPress site.

### Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   An OpenAI API key.
-   WordPress credentials (URL, username, and application password).

### Workflow

1.  **Initialization:** Takes a YouTube video ID as input and creates a directory to store the generated assets.
2.  **Transcription:** Transcribes the YouTube video and saves the transcript to a file.
3.  **Content Analysis & Summarization:** Analyzes the transcript to identify the main topics and generates a summary for each.
4.  **Blog Post Generation:** Creates a separate blog post for each topic, using the summary and the full transcript for context.
5.  **Featured Image Generation:** Generates a featured image for each blog post using an AI text-to-image model.
6.  **WordPress Publication:** Publishes the blog posts to WordPress as drafts, with their corresponding featured images.

### Usage

The `workflows/autoblog.workflow.md` file describes the manual steps of the workflow. It can be used inside a AI Agent tool. Using Gemini CLI a prompt like: "Run the @autblog.workflow.md script" can do the trick.

To run the individual scripts:

-   **Transcribe a video:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/transcribe.py <video_id>
    ```
-   **Generate an image:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/generate_image.py "<prompt>" <output_path>
    ```
-   **Upload a post to WordPress:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/wordpress_uploader.py "<title>" <content_path> [image_path]
    ```

## Video Cuts Workflow

This workflow automates the process of extracting valuable segments from a YouTube video, generating corresponding thumbnails, and uploading them as new videos to a YouTube channel.

### Features

-   **YouTube Video Download:** Downloads the full video and its subtitles.
-   **Content Analysis & Cut Point Identification:** Analyzes the transcript to identify interesting and valuable video segments.
-   **Cuts Metadata Generation:** Creates a markdown file with titles, descriptions, and timestamps for each cut.

-   A YouTube API key.
-   An OpenAI API key.
-   **Google Cloud Project Configuration for YouTube Uploads**:
    To enable YouTube video uploads, you need to configure a Google Cloud Project, enable the YouTube Data API v3, and create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials (Desktop app type). Download the `client_secret.json` file and place it in the project's root directory.

### Workflow

1.  **Initialization:** Takes a YouTube video URL as input and creates a dedicated directory for assets.
2.  **Video and Subtitle Download:** Downloads the video and its auto-generated subtitles.
3.  **Content Analysis & Cut Point Identification:** Identifies interesting segments (cuts) within the video based on the transcript.
4.  **Cuts Metadata Generation:** Compiles metadata (title, description, timestamps) for each identified cut into a markdown file.
5.  **Video Cutting:** Creates individual video files for each cut.
6.  **Thumbnail Generation and Resizing:** Generates an AI-powered image for each cut's title and resizes it to the optimal YouTube thumbnail format.
7.  **Video Upload:** Uploads each video cut to YouTube, including its generated thumbnail.
8.  **Completion:** Notifies the user upon successful completion of the entire process.

### Usage

The `workflows/video-cuts.workflow.md` file describes the manual steps of the workflow. It can be used inside a AI Agent tool. Using Gemini CLI a prompt like: "Run the @video-cuts.workflow.md script" can do the trick.

## YouTube Video to Shorts Workflow

This workflow outlines the step-by-step process for downloading a YouTube video and its subtitles, analyzing the content to find valuable segments, creating YouTube Shorts from those segments, and generating metadata for a shorts channel.

### Features

-   **YouTube Video Download:** Downloads the full video and its subtitles.
-   **Content Analysis & Cut Point Identification:** Analyzes the transcript to identify interesting and valuable video segments.
-   **Shorts Metadata Generation:** Creates a markdown file with titles, descriptions, and timestamps for each cut.
-   **Video Cutting and Speed Adjustment:** Extracts the identified segments as separate video files and adjusts their speed.

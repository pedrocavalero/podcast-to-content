# LinkedIn Content Repurposing Guide

## Strategy Overview

**Primary: LinkedIn Posts (2-3x per week)**
- LinkedIn's algorithm heavily favors native posts over articles
- Posts get 5-10x more visibility and engagement
- Share key insights from your blog articles as posts (300-500 words)
- Include a comment with a link to the full article on your blog
- Use document carousels (PDF slides) for high-value content - they get excellent reach

**Secondary: LinkedIn Newsletter (1x per week or bi-weekly)**
- Creates a dedicated subscriber base (notifications sent to all subscribers)
- Positions you as a thought leader with consistent expertise
- Subscribers get notified of every issue, guaranteeing reach
- Shows long-term commitment to your niche
- Can repurpose your best blog content with LinkedIn-specific angles

**Avoid: LinkedIn Articles**
- Much lower algorithmic distribution than posts
- LinkedIn has de-prioritized them in recent years
- Better to drive traffic to your own blog for SEO and list building

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Week 1-4:** Start with 3 posts/week to test engagement
2. **Week 5:** Launch newsletter if posts are getting traction
3. **Ongoing:**
   - Monday: Regular post
   - Wednesday: Newsletter issue (repurposed blog content)
   - Friday: Engagement post (shorter, discussion-focused)

## The 5-Step Repurposing Method

### 1. Extract the Hook (First 2 Lines)

Your blog's intro won't work on LinkedIn. Create a scroll-stopping hook:

**Blog:** "In this article, I'll discuss the importance of..."

**LinkedIn:** "I just realized most developers are wasting 40% of their time on legacy code.

Here's what nobody tells you:"

### 2. Use the "One Idea Per Post" Rule

A 2,000-word blog article = 3-5 LinkedIn posts

**Example breakdown:**
- Blog: "Complete Guide to Microservices Architecture"
- Post 1: "The #1 mistake teams make when adopting microservices"
- Post 2: "3 signs your monolith should stay a monolith"
- Post 3: "How we reduced deployment time by 60% with this pattern"

### 3. Transform Structure

**Blog format:**
- Long paragraphs
- Academic tone
- Deep explanations

**LinkedIn format:**
```
Strong hook

Micro-story or context (2-3 lines)

• Bullet point 1
• Bullet point 2
• Bullet point 3

Conclusion or question

P.S. Link in comments ← (put blog link here)
```

### 4. Repurposing Formulas

#### Formula A: The Insight
```
I analyzed [X] and found something surprising:

[Your main finding]

Here's what this means for [audience]:
→ Point 1
→ Point 2
→ Point 3

The takeaway: [conclusion]

Full breakdown: [link in comments]
```

#### Formula B: The Story
```
Last [timeframe], I [problem/situation]

The result? [outcome]

Here's what worked:

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

[Call to action or question]
```

#### Formula C: The Contrarian Take
```
Unpopular opinion:

[Bold statement that challenges common belief]

Here's why:
• Reason 1
• Reason 2
• Reason 3

Instead, try [your approach]

```

### 5. Post the Link Strategically

**Don't:** Put link in main post (kills reach)

**Do:** Write "Full article in comments" and immediately comment with:
```
Here's the complete guide: [your blog URL]

What's your experience with [topic]?
```

## Content Calendar Template

- **Monday:** Insight post (main concept from latest blog)
- **Wednesday:** Story post (case study/experience from blog)
- **Friday:** Quick tip (actionable takeaway)

Rotate through 1-2 blogs per week this way.

## Practical Example

**Blog title:** "Why Your Microservices Architecture is Failing"

### LinkedIn Post 1 (Monday):
```
We moved to microservices to scale faster.

Instead, we added 3 months to every release.

The problem wasn't microservices. It was these 3 architectural decisions:

→ No clear service boundaries
→ Synchronous communication everywhere
→ Shared databases "for efficiency"

Sound familiar?

Here's what we changed: [link in comments]

What's been your biggest microservices challenge?
```

### LinkedIn Post 2 (Wednesday):
```
"Just use microservices" they said.

"It'll be easy" they said.

6 months later:
• 40 services
• 15-minute deployments became 2 hours
• Team morale at all-time low

The turning point? [Share the solution from your blog]

## Key Tips for Authority Building

- **Engage in comments:** Spend 15 min/day commenting on others' posts in your niche
- **Hook + Value:** First 2 lines must grab attention (mobile feed preview)
- **Native content wins:** Write directly in LinkedIn, don't just link out
- **Track metrics:** Engagement rate > follower count for authority
- **Consistency matters:** Post regularly to build momentum
- **Be conversational:** Write like you're talking to a colleague, not writing a paper

# YouTube Video to Cuts Workflow

This document outlines the step-by-step process for downloading a YouTube video and its subtitles, analyzing the content to find valuable segments, creating video cuts from those segments, and generating metadata for a cuts channel.

**Executor:** Gemini CLI

---

### **Step 1: Initialization**

1.  **Ask the user for the YouTube video URL.**
    *   Store this value as `YOUTUBE_URL`.
2.  **Ask the user for their website URL.**
    *   Store this value as `USER_WEBSITE`.
3.  **Extract the video ID** from the `YOUTUBE_URL`.
    *   Store this value as `VIDEO_ID`.
4.  **Create a directory** named `cuts-{VIDEO_ID}` to store all generated assets.

### **Step 2: Video and Subtitle Download**

1.  **Execute the download script.**
    *   Run the command: `source .venv/bin/activate && yt-dlp -P cuts-{VIDEO_ID} --write-auto-subs --sub-format srt "{YOUTUBE_URL}"`
2.  **Note**:
    *   In case of error and the video or subtitles are not downloaded, stop the workflow.

### **Step 3: Content Analysis & Cut Point Identification**

1.  **Read the subtitle file** from `cuts-{VIDEO_ID}/*.srt`.
2.  **Analyze the transcript to identify 5 interesting and valuable cuts** for a developer audience. Each cut should be between 5 and 10 minutes long.
3.  **For each cut, define the following:**
    *   Start time (`start_time`)
    *   End time (`end_time`)
    *   A catchy and descriptive title (`title`)
    *   A detailed and engaging `description` of the cut's content. The description must:
        *   Be written in a compelling and engaging tone, using emojis to highlight key points and create visual interest.
        *   Integrate timestamps (e.g., `00:45`) naturally within the descriptive text, highlighting at least 3 key moments or topics discussed at those points. Use bulleted lists of timestamps but make the description of each line visually atractive with emojis. Make sure the timestamps are based on the cut video time, not from the original one.
        *   Clearly mention the original video's name and provide the `YOUTUBE_URL`.
        *   Include a clear and concise call-to-action with a link to the user's website (`USER_WEBSITE`).

### **Step 4: Cuts Metadata Generation**

1.  **Create a new file** named `cuts-{VIDEO_ID}/cuts.md`.
2.  **For each of the 5 cuts, add the following information** to the `cuts.md` file in a YouTube-friendly format:

    ```
    ## {title}

    **Start and End time:**
    Start Time: {start_time}
    End Time: {end_time}
    Name of the cut file: cut{number}.mp4

    **Description:**

    {description}

    --- 
    ```

### **Step 5: Video Cutting**

1.  **For each of the 5 cuts, calculate the duration** of the cut in seconds (`{duration}` = `{end_time}` - `{start_time}`).
2.  **Execute the following command to cut the video with a 2-second fade-in and fade-out:**
    *   `ffmpeg -ss {start_time} -i "cuts-{VIDEO_ID}/{video_file}" -t {duration} -vf "fade=in:d=2, fade=out:d=2:st={duration}-2" -af "afade=in:d=2, afade=out:d=2:st={duration}-2" "cuts-{VIDEO_ID}/cut{N}.mp4" -y`
    *   Where `{video_file}` is the name of the source video file in `cuts-{VIDEO_ID}` (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mkv`), `{N}` is the cut number (1-5), and `{duration}` is the calculated duration in seconds.

### **Step 6: Thumbnail Generation and Resizing**

1.  **For each cut, generate a thumbnail with a prompt that clearly describes the desired output:**
    *   Create a variable `PROMPT` with the following content: "Generate a YouTube thumbnail for a video about software development. The thumbnail must prominently feature the text: '{title}'. The design should be eye-catching, modern, and relevant to the video's content to maximize audience engagement. The image should be interesting enough to make a developer want to click on it."
    *   Run the command: `source .venv/bin/activate && python scripts/generate_image.py "{PROMPT}" "cuts-{VIDEO_ID}/cut{N}_thumbnail_raw.png" --model "gpt-image-1" --size "1536x1024"`
    NOTE: Do not change the model or the size!!!!!
2.  **Resize the generated thumbnail to YouTube's recommended size (1280x720):**
    *   Run the command: `source .venv/bin/activate && python scripts/resize_image.py "cuts-{VIDEO_ID}/cut{N}_thumbnail_raw.png" "cuts-{VIDEO_ID}/cut{N}_thumbnail_1280x720.png" --width 1280 --height 720`

### **Step 7: Video Upload**

1.  **For each cut, upload the video to YouTube with its generated thumbnail:**
    *   Run the command: `source .venv/bin/activate && python scripts/upload_youtube_video.py --file "cuts-{VIDEO_ID}/cut{N}.mp4" --title "{title}" --description "{description}" --thumbnail "cuts-{VIDEO_ID}/cut{N}_thumbnail_1280x720.png"`

### **Step 8: Completion**

1.  **Notify the user** that the process is complete and all video cuts, thumbnails, and the metadata file have been created and uploaded in the `cuts-{VIDEO_ID}` directory.
